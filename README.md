# ⚔️ Anime Styled Developer Portfolio

An immersive, anime-inspired personal portfolio built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**.  
This project presents my journey as a developer through a game-like narrative — *The Beginning → Origins → Dungeons → Inventory → Rank & Trials → Status Window → Guild Card*.

> “Strength was not given — it was built.”

## 🌌 Live Concept

This portfolio is designed like an **RPG / anime interface**, where:
- Each page represents a **stage of growth**
- Projects are shown as **cleared dungeons**
- Skills appear inside an **inventory**
- Resume exists as a **Status Window**
- Contact info is presented as a **Guild Card**
